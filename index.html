            <h1>Happy Valentine's Day!</h1>
            <p>To my favorite person,</p>
            <p>Thank you for being with me over almost a year, It's our first valentine. I can't really express how happy I am whilst I'm making this for you and it's because you deserve every bit. We had our fair bits of argument and misunderstandings but those kept use much more stronger than we were starting to know each other. You were there at the good and both bad times, made me change throughout the year and honestly this is what I truly needed and required of. Distance is the strongest thing keeping us from being more close but that didn't harm our bond together but rather made it much better and beautiful. You tease with me, joke around me is what makes me happy and childish because you brought out the child inside of me which was hidden for several years. I feel so open and relieved when you're at call or just feeling your presence throuhg a screen. You made me want a bright future that has you all over it and made me work hard for it which I really wanted. I'm not just your valentine for one day but want to be your valentine every single day. Keep smiling love and we can be together for longer. You make every day brighter just by being you. I'm so lucky to have you in my life!</p>
            <p>With love, <br> <strong>Tihan</strong></p>
